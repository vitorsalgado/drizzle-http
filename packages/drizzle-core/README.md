This is core package for Drizzle-HTTP. All modules are based on this core project.  
This is **vanilla Typescript** project that **doesn't** contains external dependencies.

```
npm i @drizzle-http/core
npm i @drizzle-http/undici
```

This way, you will have the core components and the Undici HTTP client implementation.
